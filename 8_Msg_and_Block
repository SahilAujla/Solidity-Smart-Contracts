-------------------MSG-DEEP-DIVE----------------------------------------------------------------

msg.sender = the wallet address of the person who's interacting with the smart contract.
msg.data = Hash of the information that is sent to solidity and to the smart contract with the information that is needed in order to just run the correct function. (it contains a function and it's parameters)
msg.sig = only contains signature of the function.
msg.value = value is that is sent by whoever is interacting with the contract -- value in wei.
tx.gas = gas fee that was used in the transaction.
tx.origin = address of the first person who started the transaction.

Example 1: 

Person A --> Contract A 
msg.sender = wallet address of Person A

Example 2: 

Person A --> Contract A --> Contract B
msg.sender = wallet address of Contract A.
tx.orignin = wallet address of Person A. (true for even a long chain).

---------------------BLOCK-DEEP-DIVE-----------------------------------------------------------

block.timestamp = returns current block timestamp in epoch (number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1st 1970).
block.chainid = returns the blockchain id (used to confirm the use of the intended blockchain, not another fork).
--> This came out when Ethereum classic was formed to avoid confusion. Ethereum has an id of 1.

block.coinbase - returns the address of current block's miner.
block.gaslimit - returns current block's gas limit
--> gas limit = maximum sum of gas fees for the block.

block.number - returns the current block number.
block.difficulty - returns current block difficulty.
(block.difficulty is often used to get random numbers because solidity doesn't have random function like other languages)

blockhash() - returns the hash of the current block.
gasleft() - returns the gas left for the current transaction/contract.
